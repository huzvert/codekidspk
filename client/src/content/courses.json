      "description": "The Python coding 1 course is designed for late primary to secondary aged students who are looking to learn to code using a proper “grown-up” programming language. Students will learn to code in Python and create fun games and useful applications. Python is particularly suitable for this age group because it is concise, easy to read and has multiple applications in the real world (web development, app development and other scientific uses such as data science). It is the most popular programming language in the world and is widely used by all the leading tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. This class is a great introduction to both fundamental coding concepts and the Python programming language. After this course, students will be comfortable coding in Python and have the confidence to extend their knowledge at home.",
