      "description": "Python Level 3 is designed to elevate students' programming skills with a focus on advanced concepts and object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will delve into functional programming using lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce functions, enhancing their ability to process data efficiently. They'll also learn to utilize regular expressions for tasks such as password validation and text manipulation. The course emphasizes the transition to OOP, covering foundational concepts like classes, objects, attributes, and methods. Students will explore the benefits of OOP over procedural programming through hands-on projects like building a Tic Tac Toe game using Tkinter. They'll gain proficiency in defining classes, creating objects, and understanding the distinction between class attributes and instance attributes. Advanced topics include constructors (__init__ method), destructors (__del__ method), inheritance, and polymorphism, essential for developing scalable and modular applications. By the end of Python Level 3, students will have a solid grasp of OOP principles and be capable of designing and implementing complex projects using Python and Tkinter.",
