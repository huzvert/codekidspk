        "description": "This course is designed for late primary to secondary aged students who are looking to learn to code using a proper “grown-up” programming language. Learn to code in Python and develop fun games. Python is particularly suitable for this age group because it is concise and easy to read and has multiple applications in the real world (web development, app development and other scientific uses such as data science). This camp is a great introduction to both fundamental programming concepts and the Python programming language. By the end, the students will be comfortable programming in Python and taking their newly acquired programming skills home",
